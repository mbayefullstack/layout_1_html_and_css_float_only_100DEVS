layout_1_html_and_css_float_only_100DEVS

Overview
This project, titled layout_1_html_and_css_float_only_100DEVS, involves creating a static web page inspired by the BBC News website, based on a reference image provided during Leon Noel's Cohort 2, Lesson 8. The goal is to replicate the structure and design of the referenced page using only fundamental HTML and CSS techniques.

Key Features
Navigation Bar: Contains links to various sections, such as Home, News, and Sport.
Hero Section: Showcases the main story with an image and caption.
News Sections: Categorized sections for different news topics.
Optional Footer: Provides space for additional navigation or contact information.

Technologies and Constraints
HTML5: Used for structuring the page content.
CSS3: Used for styling and layout.
No Classes or IDs: The layout avoids the use of classes and IDs in the HTML structure.
CSS Floats Only: All elements are positioned and styled using floats.
